# Network Graph Visualisation and Inspection Tool

## Description

Information represented in a graph/network-based form can be defined as a set of nodes with edges between them. This project aims to provide a lightweight, web-based graph/network visualisation and inspection tool. It allows analysts to visualize and understand networks, undertake basic network graph analytics, compare multiple graphs/networks, and highlight structural similarities or differences.

## Features

- **Web-Based Tool:** Access the tool through a web browser for ease of use.
- **Graph Analytics:** Perform basic network graph analytics within the tool.
- **Multi-Graph Comparison:** Compare multiple graphs/networks simultaneously.
- **Structural Highlighting:** Assist analysts in identifying notable structural similarities or differences.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:

- Navigate to root directory and run `npm install`

3. Set up environment variables:

- Create a `.env` file and add the necessary variables.

4. Run the application:

## Usage

1. Access the tool through the provided URL.
2. Upload or input the graphs/networks for visualisation.
3. Explore graph analytics and use comparison features to highlight structural insights.

## Configuration
